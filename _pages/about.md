Hello There! My name is Samarth Jain (I know it is hard to pronounce, so you can call me Sam) and I am a Software Engineer with 5+ years of Experience who loves solving complex problems when it comes to Backend Engineering and Distributed Computing using my acquired skill set. I have created this blog to share my knowledge of everything related to Backend Software Engineering and distil it down into easily understandable 
posts, so keep and eye out for new posts every third day!
